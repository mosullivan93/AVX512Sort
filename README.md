# AVX512Sort.jl

This is an experimental package that provides julia functions `qsort!` and `pqsort!` which use the AVX512 accelerated sorting methods developed in [x86-simd-sort](https://github.com/mosullivan93/x86-simd-sort).

You will need to compile the library manually after adding the package to your project space.
